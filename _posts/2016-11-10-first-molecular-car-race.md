<p>French laboratories will participate in  a molecular car race. These are molecules car-shaped that can run over a gold plate. The goal is to complete a race track. Even if the track is only some nanometer it can took up to 38 hours to reach the line. The goal is to improve better methods of microscopes and methods to see molecules.
