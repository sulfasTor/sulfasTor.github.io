<p>
I decided to learn rust so I tried to write a sed replacement in sed. It's very basic but it can handle s (substituion) and y (transliteration) commands and some flags. Implementing other important flags is on my radar but no planned soon. I want to work on other rust project which includes embeddings and Raspberry Pi Pico.
