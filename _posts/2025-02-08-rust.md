# Learning rust by implementing sed
I decided to learn rust so I tried to write a sed replacement in sed. 

According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)):
Rust is a general-purpose programming language emphasizing performance, type safety, and concurrency. It enforces memory safety, meaning that all references point to valid memory. It does so without a traditional garbage collector; instead, memory safety errors and data races are prevented by the "borrow checker", which tracks the object lifetime of references at compile time. 

I started to look at Rust Book which is the official documentation to learn Rust.

My sed implementation is very basic but it can handle `s` (substitution) and `y` (transliteration) commands and some flags. Implementing other important flags is on my radar but no planned soon. I want to work on other rust project which includes embeddings and Raspberry Pi Pico.

## Example
```bash
echo "foo is not bar but bar is foo" | sed-rust 's/foo/bar/g'
```
