# Learning rust by implementing sed
I decided to learn rust so I tried to write a sed replacement in sed. 

It's very basic but it can handle =s= (substitution) and =y= (transliteration) commands and some flags. Implementing other important flags is on my radar but no planned soon. I want to work on other rust project which includes embeddings and Raspberry Pi Pico.

## Example
```bash
echo "foo is not bar but bar is foo" | sed-rust 's/foo/bar/g'
```

You can find code here: <https://github.com/sulfasTor/sed-rust.git>
