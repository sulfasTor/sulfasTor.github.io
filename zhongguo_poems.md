	紅日已高三丈透，<br>
	金爐次第添香獸，<br>
	紅錦地衣隨步皺。<br>

	佳人舞點金釵溜，<br>
	酒惡時拈花蕊嗅，<br>
	別殿遙聞簫鼓奏。<br>

      <b>English translation</b><br><br>
      The morning sun has already risen, <br>
      fully thirty feet high. <br>
      Golden tripods, one after another, are filled <br>
      with incense animals. <br>
      The red brocade carpet <br>
      rufles with every step. <br>
      <br><br>

      The lovely one dances tip-toe, <br>
      her golden hairpin slippen out; <br>
      <br>
      Nauseated by wine, she often plucks <br>
      flower buds to smell, <br>
      While from the other palace is heard dimly <br>
      <br>
      the music of fifes and drums. <br></p>
